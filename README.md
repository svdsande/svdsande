## Hi, I’m Stijn 👋

Software engineer living in the south of The Netherlands. In my spare time I spend a lot of time on my writing code and learning new stuff. On the weekends you can find me at my local [scout group](http://scoutinggoirle.nl/) as a voluntary leader. I also love to run and play the guitar.  

👀 I’m interested in anything full-stack related  
🎵 Always on the lookout for some new vinyl records  
🏃 Training for my next marathon
